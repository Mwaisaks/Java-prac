//Create a class that implements the Runnable Interface
//Variable declaration, constructor and override the run method

//Main class
public class RunnableDemo {

        //pass the instances in the Thread constructor

//If your class is intended to be executed as a thread then
//you can achieve this by implementing a Runnable interface.
